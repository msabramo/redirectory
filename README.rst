Fill this in...

The original motivation for this is in this blog post:
http://marc-abramowitz.com/archives/2013/07/19/python-context-manager-for-redirected-stdout-and-stderr/

There is some long and confusing background in
http://bugs.python.org/issue15805 â€” where that started out as a very simple
context manager that doesn't deal with subprocesses, then folks suggested a
whole bunch of more complex stuff, and then they ultimately decided to go back
to doing something super simple and suggested that other more advanced stuff go
in a separate issue.

TL;DR is that issue15805 is going to be something simple and more for beginners
but they're open to doing something fancier with subprocesses in a separate
issue that I think is yet to be filed...
